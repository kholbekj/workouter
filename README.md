#Workouter
This is a small rails app for displaying in a convenient way, the contents of a workout pdf file.
For copyright reasons, the database seed nessecary to seed this applicaiton cannot be supplied,
but the functionality remains - create a few models linking to two pictures each, grouped by focus,
and it'll allow you to chose a focus and see 'flipable' pages from that group by random.

Truly groundbreaking tech right there.
